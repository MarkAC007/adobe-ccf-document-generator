 testing covers the entire CDE perimeter and critical data systems
 testing verifies that CDE perimeter segmentation is operational
 testing is performed from both inside and outside the CDE network
 testing validates segmentation and scope-reduction controls (e.g., tokenization processes)
 network layer penetration tests include components that support network functions as well as operating systems 
 at the application level, testing provides coverage, at a minimum, against the security testing requirements defined in VM-05-01 (01)
 testing is performed with consideration of threats verified in the last 12 months from external alerts, directives, and advisories defined in VM-06-02
 testing is performed with consideration of vulnerabilities reported through Organization's PSIRT process within the last 12 months
